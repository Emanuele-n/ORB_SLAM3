The dataset consists of 3 bronchoscopy videos recorded in an ex-vivo human lung, accompanied by camera pose ground truth. The videos are 15fps, saved as frames in the folder imgs.

The poses was tracked by an electromagnetic tracker (EMT) attached to the camera. Each video has 2 files with pose data. emt_transformed.csv is a downsampled and calibrated version of emt_rawdata.csv to match the video frequency and camera coordinate system. Further details of the calibration process are included in our paper.

For reference, here is the EMT to camera rotation matrix:

R = np.array([[0.45042269, -0.88777651, -0.09472207],
              [0.89279368, 0.44712913, 0.05472643],
              [-0.00623184, -0.1092173, 0.99399836]])
